### **Understanding the Problem**

- **Problem:**  
  Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, split `nums` into `k` non-empty contiguous subarrays. Your goal is to minimize the largest sum among these subarrays. In other words, you want to choose a split such that the maximum sum over all subarrays is as small as possible, and then return that minimized largest sum.

- **What Is Being Asked:**  
  Find the smallest possible value `X` such that `nums` can be partitioned into at most `k` subarrays, each having a sum no larger than `X`.

---

### **Key Insight**

- **Monotonicity:**  
  If you can split the array into `k` subarrays with a candidate maximum sum `X`, then any value greater than `X` will also work. Conversely, if you cannot, then any value lower than `X` won’t work either. This monotonic behavior makes the problem a good candidate for binary search.

- **Greedy Feasibility Check:**  
  For a given candidate maximum sum, use a greedy approach to simulate splitting the array. Traverse the array and form subarrays such that each subarray’s sum does not exceed the candidate value. Count the number of subarrays needed; if the count is ≤ `k`, then the candidate is feasible.

---

### **Constraints and Observations**

- **Constraints:**
    - \(1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10^3\)
    - \(0 \leq \text{nums}[i] \leq 10^4\)
    - \(1 \leq k \leq \text{nums.length}\)

- **Observations:**
    - The minimum possible value for the largest subarray sum is `max(nums)` (if every subarray could be made to have exactly one element where needed).
    - The maximum possible value is `sum(nums)` (if we put all elements into one subarray).
    - The answer lies in the range \([ \text{max(nums)}, \text{sum(nums)} ]\).

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Binary Search:**  
  The binary search runs over the range from `max(nums)` to `sum(nums)`. Let \(S\) be the sum of `nums`. The number of iterations is \(O(\log S)\).

- **Feasibility Check:**  
  For each candidate value, we traverse the entire array (i.e., \(O(n)\)).

- **Overall Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(n \cdot \log S)\), which is efficient given the constraints.

---

### **Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Extra Space:**  
  We only use a few variables for counters and indices. No additional data structures are required.
- **Overall Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(1)\).

---

### **Edge Cases**

1. **k = 1:**  
   The only valid split is the entire array, so the answer is `sum(nums)`.

2. **k = nums.length:**  
   Each subarray consists of a single element, so the answer is `max(nums)`.

3. **Array with All Equal Elements:**  
   Both the minimum and maximum values will be the same, making the splits straightforward.

4. **Small Arrays:**  
   Ensure the solution works when the array has only one element.

---

### **Example Walk-through**

Consider:
- `nums = [7, 2, 5, 10, 8]`
- `k = 2`

**Step 1:**
- Minimum candidate \(= \max(nums) = 10\)
- Maximum candidate \(= \text{sum(nums)} = 32\)

**Step 2: Binary Search Iterations**

1. **Candidate = 21:**
    - Traverse array:
        - Subarray 1: 7 + 2 + 5 = 14
        - Adding 10 makes 24 (exceeds 21), so split here.
        - Subarray 2: 10 + 8 = 18
    - Total subarrays = 2 (feasible)

2. **Try Lower Candidate (narrow search):**
    - Continue binary search until the smallest feasible candidate is found.
    - In this example, the answer turns out to be **18**.

### **Java Implementation**

```java
public class SplitArrayLargestSum {
    public int splitArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Lower bound is the maximum element, upper bound is the sum of all elements.
        int low = 0, high = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            low = Math.max(low, num);
            high += num;
        }
        
        // Binary search for the minimal largest sum.
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canSplit(nums, k, mid)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return low;
    }
    
    // Helper function to check if the array can be split into at most k subarrays with each sum <= maxSum.
    private boolean canSplit(int[] nums, int k, int maxSum) {
        int count = 1;  // Start with one subarray
        int currentSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum > maxSum) {
                // Start a new subarray
                currentSum = num;
                count++;
                if (count > k) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SplitArrayLargestSum solver = new SplitArrayLargestSum();
        
        int[] nums1 = {7, 2, 5, 10, 8};
        int k1 = 2;
        System.out.println(solver.splitArray(nums1, k1)); // Expected Output: 18
        
        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k2 = 2;
        System.out.println(solver.splitArray(nums2, k2)); // Additional test case
    }
}
```

### **Alternative Optimization**

- **Dynamic Programming Approach:**  
  One might consider using DP where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum largest sum for splitting the first `i` numbers into `j` subarrays. However, that approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\), which is less efficient than the binary search method for our constraints.

- **Takeaway:**  
  When the search space is monotonic, binary search combined with a greedy check (like `canSplit`) is often the best approach.

---

### **Takeaways**

- **Binary Search on Answer:**  
  This technique is very powerful for optimization problems where the solution space is monotonic.

- **Greedy Feasibility Check:**  
  Use a greedy method to quickly validate if a candidate solution works.

- **Optimization Patterns:**  
  Problems like these (including "Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days") can be solved using similar patterns.

- **Efficiency:**  
  The final solution runs in \(O(n \cdot \log S)\) time and uses \(O(1)\) space, which is optimal for the given constraints.
