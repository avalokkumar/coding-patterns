### **Understanding the Problem**

We need to build an array `nums` of length `n` such that:
1. `nums[index]` is as large as possible.
2. Each element is at least 1.
3. The absolute difference between adjacent elements is at most 1.
4. The sum of all elements does not exceed `maxSum`.

We need to return the maximum value at `nums[index]`.

### **Key Insight**

- The problem can be rephrased as:
  *"What is the highest possible integer `x` we can place at `nums[index]` while maintaining all the constraints?"*

- Notice that if `nums[index] = x`, the array forms a "peak" at `index`. Values decrease by 1 as we move away from `index` until reaching 1.

- To check if a given `x` is possible:
    - Calculate the sum required for this `x`.
    - If the sum is less than or equal to `maxSum`, it is a valid `x`.
    - Otherwise, we need to decrease `x`.

This leads us to a **Binary Search** approach.

---

### **Approach: Binary Search on `x`**

- **Search space:** `low = 1` to `high = maxSum`.
- **Mid:** `(low + high) / 2`.
- Check if we can create an array with `nums[index] = mid` without exceeding `maxSum`.
- Adjust the binary search boundaries based on the feasibility.

### **How to Calculate the Required Sum for a Given `x`?**

**Case 1: Left side of the array (indices 0 to index-1):**
- If `x > left_count` (where `left_count = index`), we form a decreasing sequence from `x-1` down to `x-left_count`.
- If `x <= left_count`, the left side becomes `[x-1, x-2, ..., 1, 1, 1...]`.

**Case 2: Right side of the array (indices index+1 to n-1):**
- Similarly, apply the same logic for the right side.

**Formula for sum of decreasing sequence:**  
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{(x + 1) \times x}{2} - \text{sum of trimmed elements if any}
\]

---

### **Time Complexity:**
- **O(log(maxSum))** due to binary search.
- Each feasibility check is O(1).
- Overall complexity: **O(log(maxSum))**.

---

### **Space Complexity:**
- **O(1)** as we use constant extra space.

### **Java Code Implementation**

```java
class MaximumValueBoundedArray {
    public int maxValue(int n, int index, int maxSum) {
        int low = 1, high = maxSum;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;  // Try a higher mid
            if (isValid(mid, n, index, maxSum)) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    private boolean isValid(int x, int n, int index, int maxSum) {
        long sum = x;  // The peak at index

        // Left side
        int leftCount = index;
        if (x > leftCount) {
            sum += sumOfSequence(x - 1, x - leftCount);
        } else {
            sum += sumOfSequence(x - 1, 1) + (leftCount - (x - 1));
        }

        // Right side
        int rightCount = n - index - 1;
        if (x > rightCount) {
            sum += sumOfSequence(x - 1, x - rightCount);
        } else {
            sum += sumOfSequence(x - 1, 1) + (rightCount - (x - 1));
        }

        return sum <= maxSum;
    }

    private long sumOfSequence(long start, long end) {
        // Sum of arithmetic sequence from start to end
        return (start + end) * (start - end + 1) / 2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumValueBoundedArray solver = new MaximumValueBoundedArray();
        System.out.println(solver.maxValue(4, 2, 6));  // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solver.maxValue(6, 1, 10)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### **Dry Run**

**Example:**  
`n = 4, index = 2, maxSum = 6`

- **Binary search range:** `low = 1, high = 6`.
- **mid = 3:** Check feasibility.
    - Left: `[2, 1]`, Right: `[2]`, Peak: `3`.
    - Sum = 2+1+3+2 = 8 > 6 (Not feasible)
- Adjust high to `2`.

- **mid = 2:** Check feasibility.
    - Left: `[1, 1]`, Right: `[1]`, Peak: `2`.
    - Sum = 1+1+2+1 = 5 â‰¤ 6 (Feasible)
- Adjust low to `2`.

**Answer:** `2`.

---

### **Edge Cases to Consider**
1. **Minimum array size (n=1):** Just return `maxSum`.
2. **Large `maxSum` with small `n`:** Ensure no integer overflow.
3. **When `x` is at the boundary (1 or maxSum):** Handle edge cases when the peak is at the smallest or largest value.
4. **Skewed array (index at start or end):** Test with `index = 0` or `index = n-1`.
