### **Understanding the Problem**

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Given a string `word` (with unique, lowercase English letters), generate and return all possible permutations of the string. The order in which the permutations are returned does not matter.

- **What Is Being Asked:**  
  We need to generate every possible arrangement of the characters in the string. For a string of length \( n \), there are \( n! \) permutations.

---

### **Key Insight**

- **Backtracking:**  
  A common approach for generating permutations is to use backtracking. At each step, we choose one character to add to the current permutation and then recursively generate permutations with the remaining characters.

- **Swapping Technique:**  
  Since all characters are unique, we can convert the string to a character array and use a swapping method. This way, we can generate permutations in-place by swapping characters and backtracking (i.e., swapping them back) after the recursive call.

---

### **Constraints and Observations**

- **Constraints:**
    - \(1 \leq \text{word.length} \leq 6\)
    - All characters in `word` are unique.
    - All characters are lowercase English letters.

- **Observations:**
    - The maximum number of permutations is \(6! = 720\), which is computationally trivial.
    - With unique characters, we don’t need to worry about duplicate permutations.

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  There are \( n! \) permutations, and for each permutation, we spend \( O(n) \) time (e.g., to copy or print the permutation).  
  **Overall Complexity:** \( O(n \times n!) \).

---

### **Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Space Complexity:**  
  The space required for recursion is \( O(n) \) (the maximum depth of the recursion stack).  
  Additionally, storing all permutations requires \( O(n \times n!) \) space.

- Since \( n \leq 6 \), these complexities are acceptable.

---

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Single Character:**
    - Input: `"a"` → Output: `[ "a" ]`
2. **Empty String:**
    - Input: `""` → Depending on the definition, you may return `[ "" ]` or `[]`. For this problem, assume the input string always has at least one character.

---

### **Example Walk-through**

Consider the string: `"abc"`

1. Start with `["a", "b", "c"]`.
2. Swap index `0` with itself: `"abc"`, then recursively generate permutations for the substring `"bc"`:
    - For `"bc"`, swap index `1` with itself → `"bc"` → permutation `"abc"`.
    - Swap index `1` with `2` → `"cb"` → permutation `"acb"`.
3. Swap index `0` with `1`: The array becomes `"bac"`. Now generate permutations for `"ac"`:
    - `"bac"` (with `"ac"` as is) → permutation `"bac"`.
    - Swap within `"ac"` to get `"ca"` → permutation `"bca"`.
4. Swap index `0` with `2`: The array becomes `"cba"`. Now generate permutations for `"ba"`:
    - `"cba"` (with `"ba"` as is) → permutation `"cba"`.
    - Swap within `"ba"` to get `"ab"` → permutation `"cab"`.

**Final Permutations:**  
`["abc", "acb", "bac", "bca", "cba", "cab"]`

### **Java Implementation**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Permutations {
    public List<String> getPermutations(String word) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (word == null || word.length() == 0) {
            result.add("");
            return result;
        }
        char[] arr = word.toCharArray();
        backtrack(arr, 0, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    // Backtracking function using swapping
    private void backtrack(char[] arr, int start, List<String> result) {
        if (start == arr.length) {
            result.add(new String(arr));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i < arr.length; i++) {
            swap(arr, start, i);
            backtrack(arr, start + 1, result);
            swap(arr, start, i); // backtrack: restore the array
        }
    }
    
    // Helper function to swap characters in the array
    private void swap(char[] arr, int i, int j) {
        char temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Permutations solver = new Permutations();
        String word = "abc";
        List<String> perms = solver.getPermutations(word);
        System.out.println("Permutations of " + word + ": " + perms);
    }
}
```

### **Alternative Optimization**

- **Iterative Approach:**  
  You can also generate permutations iteratively by starting with the empty set and repeatedly adding characters to each existing permutation. However, the recursive backtracking approach using swaps is very clean and efficient given the constraint \( n \leq 6 \).

- **Using Java’s Built-in Functions:**  
  Although you might consider using libraries (like Apache Commons or Guava), implementing the backtracking solution is a common interview requirement and demonstrates understanding of recursion.

---

### **Takeaways**

- **Backtracking is Key:**  
  The problem is an excellent example of using recursion and backtracking to generate all possible combinations.

- **Exponential Growth:**  
  Understand that permutation problems have \( O(n!) \) complexity, which is acceptable only for small \( n \).

- **Swapping Technique:**  
  Using in-place swapping simplifies the recursion and avoids extra space for maintaining a "used" array.

- **Clarifying Questions Matter:**  
  Asking about duplicates and order can lead to clarifying which technique to use.
