### **Understanding the Problem**

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a target sum `k`, find all possible subsets (combinations) of `nums` whose elements sum exactly to `k`.

- **What Is Being Asked:**  
  We need to generate every possible subset (ignoring order) of the input set and return only those whose elements add up to `k`.

---

### **Key Insight**

- **Backtracking:**  
  We can generate subsets using a recursive (backtracking) approach. At each decision point, we choose whether to include a specific number or not. As we build each subset, we keep track of the current sum.
- **Pruning:**  
  Since all numbers are positive, if the current sum exceeds `k`, we can stop exploring that branch immediately.

---

### **Constraints and Observations**

- **Constraints:**
    - \(1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10\)
    - Each number \(x\) in `nums` satisfies \(1 \leq x \leq 100\)
    - \(1 \leq k \leq 10^3\)
- **Observations:**
    - With \(n \leq 10\), the maximum number of subsets is \(2^{10} = 1024\), which is very manageable.
    - Since the order does not matter and each element can be used at most once, we are looking for combinations rather than permutations.

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  In the worst case, we generate all \(2^n\) subsets. For each subset, we may take up to \(O(n)\) time to compute the sum or to copy the subset into the result.  
  **Overall Complexity:** \(O(n \times 2^n)\).  
  For \(n \leq 10\), this is acceptable.

---

### **Space Complexity Analysis**

- **Space Complexity:**
    - The recursion stack will use \(O(n)\) space.
    - The space to store all valid subsets is \(O(2^n \times n)\) in the worst case, which is acceptable given \(n\) is small.

---

### **Edge Cases**

1. **No Valid Subset:**
    - If no subset sums to \(k\), return an empty list.
2. **Subset Using All Elements:**
    - It’s possible that the only valid subset is the entire array.
3. **Single Element:**
    - When \(nums\) contains one element, the subset is valid if that element equals \(k\); otherwise, no valid subset exists.
4. **Multiple Subsets:**
    - There might be multiple subsets that sum to \(k\) (order of elements in a subset doesn’t matter).

---

### **Example Walk-through**

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 5`
- **Subsets that sum to 5:**
    - `[1, 4]` because \(1 + 4 = 5\)
    - `[2, 3]` because \(2 + 3 = 5\)

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, `k = 6`
- **Subset that sums to 6:**
    - `[1, 2, 3]` because \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\)

---

### **Java Implementation**

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class KSumSubsets {

    public List<List<Integer>> kSumSubsets(int[] nums, int k) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        // Start backtracking from index 0 with an empty current subset and a current sum of 0.
        backtrack(nums, k, 0, new ArrayList<>(), 0, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int[] nums, int target, int start, List<Integer> current, int currentSum, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        // Base case: if the current sum equals the target, add a copy of the current subset to the result.
        if (currentSum == target) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }
        
        // If the current sum exceeds the target, no need to continue (prune the recursion).
        if (currentSum > target) {
            return;
        }
        
        // Try adding each remaining element to the current subset.
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            current.add(nums[i]);                       // Choose the element
            backtrack(nums, target, i + 1, current, currentSum + nums[i], result);
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);           // Backtrack: remove the element and try the next one
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KSumSubsets solver = new KSumSubsets();
        
        // Example 1:
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int target1 = 5;
        System.out.println("Subsets summing to " + target1 + ": " + solver.kSumSubsets(nums1, target1));
        // Expected output: [[1, 4], [2, 3]]
        
        // Example 2:
        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int target2 = 6;
        System.out.println("Subsets summing to " + target2 + ": " + solver.kSumSubsets(nums2, target2));
        // Expected output: [[1, 2, 3]]
    }
}
```

### **Alternative Optimization**

- **Dynamic Programming (Subset Sum Variation):**  
  For larger input sizes, one could consider a DP approach to count or enumerate subsets summing to \(k\) (similar to the Knapsack problem). However, with \(n \leq 10\), backtracking is both simple and efficient.

- **Sorting and Pruning:**  
  Sorting the array might sometimes help to prune the search space early (e.g., if adding the smallest remaining number would exceed \(k\)), but given the small \(n\), this extra step is not necessary.

---

### **Takeaways**

- **Backtracking is Ideal:**  
  For generating all combinations or subsets with constraints, backtracking offers a clear and recursive solution.
- **Effective Pruning:**  
  Since all numbers are positive, we can prune branches where the current sum exceeds \(k\).
- **Edge Cases:**  
  It’s important to consider when no subset meets the condition and to handle small inputs correctly.
- **Clarifying Questions:**  
  Always ask about the uniqueness of numbers, ordering of output, and input constraints during interviews to tailor your solution.
