### **Understanding the Problem**

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Given an array of integers `nums`, return all possible subsets (the power set) of `nums`. The solution should include the empty set as well.

- **What Is Being Asked:**  
  We need to generate every possible combination of the numbers in `nums`, regardless of order. For an array of length `n`, there are \(2^n\) possible subsets.

---

### **Clarifying Questions to Ask in an Interview**

1. **Are the elements in the input array unique?**
    - *Typically, yes. If duplicates are allowed, the problem might ask for unique subsets only.*
2. **Does the order of subsets in the output matter?**
    - *Usually not, but confirm if a specific order is required (e.g., lexicographical or by size).*
3. **Can the input array be empty?**
    - *If so, the expected output should be a list containing only the empty subset.*
4. **What is the expected size of the array?**
    - *This helps determine if an exponential solution (like \(O(2^n)\)) is acceptable.*
5. **Should the output subsets be in any particular order?**
    - *Typically, any order is acceptable unless specified.*

### **Key Insight**

- **Exponential Possibilities:**  
  Each element in the array has two possibilities: either it is included in a subset or it isn’t. This leads to \(2^n\) possible subsets.

- **Backtracking / Recursion:**  
  A common technique to generate subsets is to use backtracking (or recursion), where we decide at each step whether to include a particular element or not.

- **Iterative Approach:**  
  Alternatively, you can iteratively build subsets by starting with the empty set and, for each element in `nums`, adding it to all existing subsets.

---

### **Constraints and Observations**

- **Constraints:**
    - \(1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 10\) is typical for such problems (but could be larger if performance isn’t a major issue).
    - Elements can be any integers (both positive and negative).

- **Observations:**
    - The number of subsets grows exponentially with the size of `nums` (\(2^n\) subsets).
    - Using recursion/backtracking is a natural fit for generating all subsets.

---

### **Time Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \(O(2^n \times n)\) — there are \(2^n\) subsets and generating (or copying) each subset may take up to \(O(n)\) time.

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \(O(2^n \times n)\) — for storing all the subsets, plus the recursion stack which takes \(O(n)\).

---

### **Edge Cases**

1. **Empty Array:**
    - Input: `nums = []`
    - Output: `[ [] ]` (A list with the empty subset.)
2. **Single Element Array:**
    - Input: `nums = [1]`
    - Output: `[ [], [1] ]`
3. **Array with Duplicate Elements:**
    - Typically, if duplicates are allowed and unique subsets are required, additional care must be taken. (For this problem, we assume elements are unique unless specified otherwise.)

---

### **Example Walk-through**

Consider:  
`nums = [1, 2, 3]`

- Start with the empty set: `[ [] ]`
- For element `1`:
    - Add `1` to every subset: `[ [1] ]`
    - Combined result: `[ [], [1] ]`
- For element `2`:
    - Add `2` to every subset in current result: `[ [2], [1, 2] ]`
    - Combined result: `[ [], [1], [2], [1, 2] ]`
- For element `3`:
    - Add `3` to every subset: `[ [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3] ]`
    - Final result: `[ [], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3] ]`

### **Java Implementation (Backtracking Approach)**

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Subsets {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(nums, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int[] nums, int start, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        // Add the current subset to the result (make a copy)
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
        
        // Explore further elements to include in the current subset
        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Include nums[i]
            current.add(nums[i]);
            // Recurse with the next index
            backtrack(nums, i + 1, current, result);
            // Backtrack: remove the last element before the next iteration
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Subsets solution = new Subsets();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        List<List<Integer>> subsets = solution.subsets(nums);
        
        // Print out all subsets
        for (List<Integer> subset : subsets) {
            System.out.println(subset);
        }
    }
}
```

---

### **Alternative Optimization (Iterative Approach)**

Another common approach is to build subsets iteratively:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SubsetsIterative {
    public List<List<Integer>> subsets(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(new ArrayList<>());  // start with the empty subset
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int size = result.size();
            // For every existing subset, add the current number to form a new subset
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                List<Integer> newSubset = new ArrayList<>(result.get(i));
                newSubset.add(num);
                result.add(newSubset);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SubsetsIterative solution = new SubsetsIterative();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        List<List<Integer>> subsets = solution.subsets(nums);
        
        // Print out all subsets
        for (List<Integer> subset : subsets) {
            System.out.println(subset);
        }
    }
}
```

### **Takeaways**

- **Backtracking** is a natural approach for generating combinations, as it provides a clear recursive structure to explore all possibilities.
- **Iterative Approach:**  
  An alternative solution uses iterative expansion, which can be easier to understand in some cases.
- **Exponential Growth:**  
  Recognize that the number of subsets is \(2^n\), so exponential time and space complexity are expected.
- **Clarifying Questions:**  
  Always ask about input constraints (e.g., whether duplicates exist) to tailor your solution.
